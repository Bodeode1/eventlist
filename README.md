### Design Thinking

Employing a Design Thinking methodology, the student developer opts to explore various features perceived as most valuable by users on the finalized site. As specified in the assessment criteria, this project mandates the use of CRUD functionality, providing a fundamental structure for necessary functionalities. A preliminary evaluation has generated the following insights:

| Feature                                 | Importance | Feasibility |
|:----------------------------------------|:----------:|:-----------:|
| Creating an event                       |     5      |    5        |
| Viewing events created                  |     5      |    4        |
| Deleting events                         |     5      |    5        |
| Viewing events attendee                 |     4      |    5        |
| Editing events                          |     5      |    5        |
| Searching for an Event                  |     5      |    4        |
| Booking a Ticket to attend Event        |     5      |    4        |
| Account User Registration               |     5      |    5        |
| Admin login                             |     5      |    5        |
| **Overall Score**                       |   **44**   | **42**      |

### **Color Schema**   
The  color shema was selected from [Coolors](https://coolors.co), I add the colors from the hero image, darkened the green and orange as necessary to achieve a higher contrast with white text inside.
